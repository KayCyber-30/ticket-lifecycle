 - Assignment and Communication

  
  Assignment and Communication in ticketing refers to the process of directing the ticket to the appropriate support personnel or department and initiating clear communication with the user. This ensures the issue is being handled by the right person and that the user is kept informed about the status and next steps.

- Working the Issue

Working the Issue refers to the active phase of troubleshooting and resolving the problem described in the ticket. It involves investigating the root cause, applying fixes, documenting steps taken, and updating the ticket with progress until a solution is found.

  - Resolution

    Resolution is the final phase where the issue is successfully resolved, the solution is communicated to the user, and the ticket is closed. It may also include documenting the fix for future reference and confirming user satisfaction.
